<p> I created this website to display all my future works before entering into 
the University of Massey, Auckland Campus. I will be creating all sorts of projects so I want them all to be accessible in this portfolio. <p>

##### About the portfolio

<p> When creating the portfolio, I am trying to aim for a luxurious look for this web app, I decided to go for a black, gold and gray theme because for me that gives a high-quality and luxurious look when looking at a colour pallete. <p>

<p> I also want to add smoothness to my portfolio when scrolling when clicking on anything, like when you're opening a iphone or samsung box for the first time that slow opening that makes people think the product is worth anticipating over and going to be a good product. I will be doing this through different widgets in the website such as buttons, how the website opens, how it shifts through information. <p>

##### Updates

###### 05/08/2025

<p> This portfolio was created about 6 months ago, but I personally never felt good enough to upload the project to GitHub because for me it was never good enough, but I decided that the only way I am going to improve is to upload it and show the progress along the way <p>

<p> I have created the base of the website currently, so everything works at a *don't touch anything but scroll level*, what I personally still need to do is:

> - Make the web app work on mobile.
> - Redo the wwdul so its using a grid instead of margin.
> - Make it dynamic in a more proper way.

Then after these updates I will consider the project ready at a *base level*. I will then proceed with the *experimental* phase where I can start adding small touches that will make the portfolio my own
